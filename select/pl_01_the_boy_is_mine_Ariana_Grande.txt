How can it be? You and me
Might be meant to be,
can't unsee it
But I don't wanna cause no scene
I'm usually so unproblematic
So independent
Tell me why
'Cause the boy is mine, mine
Somethin' about him is made
for somebody like me
Baby, come over, come over
(Oh my)
And God knows I'm tryin'
But there's just no use
in denying
The boy is mine
I can't wait to try him
Let-let's get intertwined
The stars, they aligned
The boy is mine
Watch me take my time
I can't believe my mind
The boy is divine
The boy is mine
Please know this ain't
what I planned for
Probably wouldn't bet a
dime or my life on
There's gotta be a reason why
My girls, they always come
through in a sticky situation
Say it's fine
(It's fine)
Happens all the time-ime
Somethin' about him is made
for somebody like me
Baby, come over, come over
(Oh my)
And God knows I'm tryin'
But there's just no use
in denying
The boy is mine
I can't wait to try him
Let-let's get intertwined
The stars, they aligned
The boy is mine
Watch me take my time
I can't believe my mind
The boy is divine
The boy is—
And I know it's simply meant
to be
And I,
I take full accountability
for all these years
Promise you I'm not usually
Like this, shit,
it's like news to me, to me
But I can't ignore my heart, boy
The boy is mine
(Oh)
I can't wait to try him
Let-let's get intertwined
The stars, they aligned
The boy is mine
Watch me take my time
I can't believe my mind
The boy is divine
The boy is mine
