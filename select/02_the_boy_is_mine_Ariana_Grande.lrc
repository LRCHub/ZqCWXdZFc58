[00:09.96] How can it be? You and me
[00:13.55] Might be meant to be, can't unsee it
[00:17.00] But I don't wanna cause no scene
[00:19.16] I'm usually so unproblematic
[00:22.00] So independent
[00:24.09] Tell me why
[00:27.06] 'Cause the boy is mi-ine
[00:39.06] 
[00:29.58] Something about him is made for somebody like me
[00:35.77] Baby, come over, come over
[00:39.12] And God knows I'm trying, but there's just no use in denying
[01:09.12] 
[00:47.22] The boy is mine
[00:50.37] I can't wait to try him
[00:52.76] Let's get intertwined
[00:55.04] The stars, they aligned
[00:57.46] The boy is mine
[01:00.21] Watch me take my time
[01:02.36] I can't believe my mind
[01:04.88] The boy is divine
[01:07.76] Boy is mine
[01:13.26] 
[01:09.45] Please know this ain't what I planned for
[01:12.63] Probably wouldn't bet a dime or my life on
[01:16.05] There's gotta be a reason why
[01:18.20] My girls, they always come through in a sticky situation
[01:22.88] Say it's fine
[01:26.14] Happens all the ti-ime
[01:37.14] 
[01:28.39] Something about him is made for somebody like me
[01:34.63] Baby, come over, come over
[01:38.28] And God knows I'm trying, but there's just no use in denying
[02:08.28] 
[01:46.11] The boy is mine
[01:49.56] I can't wait to try him
[01:51.85] Let's get intertwined
[01:54.16] The stars, they aligned
[01:56.52] The boy is mine
[01:59.35] Watch me take my time
[02:01.23] I can't believe my mind
[02:03.92] The boy is divine
[02:06.84] Boy is
[02:09.84] 
[02:08.70] And I know it's simply meant to be
[02:11.90] And I, I take full accountability for all these tears
[02:17.71] Promise you I'm not usually
[02:20.12] Like this, sh-, it's like news to me, to me
[02:24.13] But I can't ignore my heart, boy!
[02:40.63] 
[02:26.59] The boy is mine
[02:28.88] I can't wait to try him
[02:31.07] Let's get intertwined
[02:33.55] The stars, they aligned
[02:35.91] The boy is mine
[02:38.63] Watch me take my time
[02:40.84] I can't believe my mind
[02:43.26] The boy is divine
[02:45.99] Boy is mine
